                                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                                    Complications can happen even in the best hands. What matters is how you respond. Complications during the course of medical/surgical treatment may be anticipated or may happen unexpectedly. It does not always mean medical negligence. The courts are well aware of this. Complications can occur due to several factors, which may be related to the disease process itself or the patient&apos;s aberrant body response, or unexplained reasons, besides the possibility of a deficiency of treatment & care. The courts tend to differentiate medical negligence from other reasons. What should be done to convince the court that there was no negligence in managing the complication? Some points to remember are:

                                    <li>Adequate assessment, evaluation of the patient, and due precautions were taken in the treatment & care, as per standard guidelines. This is particularly important for taking due precautions & preparations in the pre-operative period of a surgical patient.</li>
                                    <li>The treatment/procedure was conducted, as per standard guidelines</li>
                                    <li>When a complication occurs, it is detected promptly, shared with the family, and treated promptly & properly</li>
                                    <li>Honest (but tactful) communication with the family means sharing what has happened, its possible causes, the further plan of care, and the probable prognosis.</li>
                                    <li>The communication should be made directly by the treating consultant rather than a junior member of the team, even if (in odd circumstances) the communication happens physically or virtually</li>
                                    <li>The evaluation & treatment of the complication should be done as per standard guidelines</li>
                                    <li>Second opinions, if required, should be done promptly from the proper specialist. If the family has a different choice of the referral consultant, respect their choice after adequate counselling</li>
                                    <li>Referral to another hospital, if required, should be done promptly and to a proper facility and in a proper manner. If the family has a different choice of the hospital, respect their choice after adequate counselling.</li>
                                    <li>All the important aspects should be properly documented</li>

                                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 ml-4">
                                    <li>Good documentation is your strongest medicolegal defence. Courts value the medical records as credible evidence unless they are manipulated or fabricated. These records are created by the doctors in their language and are kept in their custody. There is no reason, therefore, to neglect them. If your medical records are poor, your legal defence will be poor. If an important contention is not reflected in the medical records, it will be presumed that it was not done/improperly done, as the case may be. The medical records should be carefully & legibly written or entered in EMR. Each entry should be clear, dated, timed, factual, and contemporaneous. Avoid abbreviations that are not standard. Medical records should reflect the care provided, in support of your defence. Accurate medical records and proper consent are the strongest pillars of medicolegal safety.</li>
                                    <li>Focus particularly on the Initial Assessment record, Progress notes, Informed Consent, Operation/procedure notes, Anaesthesia notes, Discharge/Death/Referral summary. Estimate sheets, counselling sheets, mortality notes, referral notes, and nursing charts are other important records to be prepared very carefully.</li>
                                    <li>Consent process should be taken seriously, as consent is the most common contentious issue in medical litigation. It should follow a detailed counselling process by a responsible member of the treating team. The consent document should be patient-specific, doctor (team) specific, procedure specific, with mention of the expected benefits and the common risks of the procedure and signatures (with name, date & time) at the correct places of the patient (if competent) or his kin (if patient is not competent), of two witnesses and the doctor who had counselled him. There should be no blank spaces. Important aspects may be handwritten, endorsed by the consent giver.</li>
                                    <li>OPD prescriptions should be complete and legibly written. Retain an office copy</li>
                                    <li>Bills & receipts should be issued as a routine</li>
                                    <li>Transfer notes (internal & external transfers) must be well documented</li>
                                    <li>All notes must have a recognizable signature, date & time</li>
                                    <li>Never fabricate/manipulate medical records</li>
                                    <li>Never issue false medical certificates</li>
                                    <li>Be very careful with the statutory documentation related to PNDT, MTP, ART & THOTA Acts and strictly follow the guidelines</li>

                                    <li>Discount should be initiated with an application from the patient/family</li>
                                    <li>Discount (on compassionate grounds) should be mentioned in the billing</li>
                                    <li>In case of complementary discounts, also, a proper bill should be generated, and the discount (on a complementary basis) mentioned</li>

                                    <li>Document the event as well as the communication</li>

                                    <li>Most of the grievances arise from the lack of understanding about the protocols and communication gaps, rather than from the doctor&apos;s lack of competence or skills</li>

                                    <li>If the grievances are serious or prolonged, the formal grievance redressal mechanism of the hospital should be activated to resolve them.</li>
                                    <li>If professional bodies at the district level have a grievance redressal mechanism in place, that may be activated</li>

                                    <li>Hospital violence is a growing concern. It should be prevented, if possible, anticipated when it can, and prudently handled under all circumstances.</li>
                                    <li>Good communication skills, frequent counselling, and a sensitive attitude generally help in preventing hospital violence.</li>
                                    <li>In vulnerable situations, anticipate trouble and alert the hospital security or the district administration, depending on the circumstances.</li>
                                    <li>During incidents of violence, prioritize safety, inform the fraternity, and try to collect in numbers. Communicate through a spokesperson. Call the hospital security and police immediately.</li>
