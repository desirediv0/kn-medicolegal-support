                                Healthcare is no longer a &apos;bed of roses&apos;. It is associated with a significant risk to doctors, staff, and equipment. Prudence demands that such risks be prevented, anticipated, and managed properly to maintain the dignity & grace of medical practice and for the safety of doctors, staff & equipment.

                                Medical litigation has emerged as a growing concern in modern clinical practice, following the inclusion of medical services under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as per a Supreme Court order in 1995, and reinforced by the enactment of the new Consumer Protection Act in 2019. While technological advances have greatly improved the diagnosis and treatment of complex ailments, they have also increased patient expectations and scrutiny of medical care. Studies show that most medico-legal disputes do not necessarily arise from clinical incompetence, medical negligence, or deficient care but from ethical and non-medical reasons.
